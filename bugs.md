bugs:
 - loading up a second song causes two lyrics objects that take turns displaying 
 - images don't change with song
 - like the previous two bugs, we have to reset app to assign lyrics to songs probably (+ have to reset the app to see the changes - reset to see lyrics)
 - not so much a bug but perhaps have a boundary for lyrics. So the last lyric of the song or verse only stays up for a few secs after its timestamp
