bugs:

- FIXED - loading up a second song causes two lyrics objects that take turns displaying
- images don't change with song
- FIXED - like the previous two bugs, we have to reset app to assign lyrics to songs probably (+ have to reset the app to see the changes - reset to see lyrics)
- not so much a bug but perhaps have a boundary for lyrics. So the last lyric of the song or verse only stays up for a few secs after its timestamp
- add error handling to image writing
