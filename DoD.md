# Definition of Done

### Must Haves for 1.0

- Fix bugs (see bugs.md)
- Basic playlist system (JSON DB)
- Make the application look nicer
- Come up with a name
- Add multiple backend routes (if somone wants lyrics and song name that's a route, just name that's a route, etc)
- Add custom controls (mainly need to work on seek bar)
- Tests


### Beyond 1.0

- Add mongoDB impl of DB
- If no lyrics available + connected to internet - fetch lyrics from an external API
